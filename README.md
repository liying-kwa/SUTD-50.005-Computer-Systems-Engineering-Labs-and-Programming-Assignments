# SUTD 50.005 Labs and Programming-Assignments
Labs and Programming Assignments completed for the ISTD Course 50.005 Computer System Engineering.

## Lab 1: Process Management
A lab that teaches the management of inter-process communication (for UNIX processes) using shared memory. Using fork() to create multiple processes, the project uses semaphores to protected and share resources between processes.

## Lab 2: Banker's Algorithm
An implementation of the Banker's Algorithm which prevents the system from entering a deadlock state in the future or immediately. Given a series of requests by processes for resources, the algorithm determines whether to reject or grant each request.

## Lab 3: TOCTOU Race Condition Attack
An investigative lab that teaches the concept of 'privileged programs' and what a Time Of Check-Time Of Use (TOCTOU) bug is.

## Lab 4: Internet Routes and Measurement of Round Trip Times
An introductory lab to networks which explores the ping and traceroute utilities.

## Programming Assignment 1
A programming activity that involves building a shell and creating a daemon process, both of which are common applications of fork().
